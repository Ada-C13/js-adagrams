Congratulations! You're submitting your assignment. Please reflect on the assignment with these questions.

## Reflection

Prompt | Response
--- | ---
What patterns were you able to use from your Ruby knowledge to apply to JavaScript? | The way to iterate over the arrays and how to iterate over the objects(hashes). 
Did you need to use different strategies to find information online about JavaScript than you would for Ruby? | Yes, I used google a lot, to find how to use some methods and the syntax. Also to find things like `...` spread syntax and static functions that are used within my class. 
What was something you needed to do independent research on for this project? What did you learn? | I learn how to create a `class`, how to define class functions using static functions that are not instances of the class. I learned about ()...) spread syntax to convert a string into an array and also to pass values into a `max` function. Also I learn a new way to iterate over objects `Object.entries`. 
What was a challenge you were able to overcome on this assignment? | The biggest challenge for me was to create the last function `highestScoreFrom`. 
What has been interesting and positive about learning a new programming language? | Many things and feel that we have been learning how to learn, feel that the basic concepts make sense even if the syntax is different. I really want to continue learning about JavaScript and improve the way my code looks. 
What is something to focus on your learnings in JavaScript in the next week? | I would love to learn more about: `classes` best practices, `APIs` and also learn about `prototype` and understand how objects inherit features from one another.
