// Our first job is to build a hand of 10 letters. To do so, add a function called `drawLetters` inside of the `Adagrams` object in `src/adagrams.js`. This method should have the following properties:

// - No parameters
// - Returns an array of ten strings
//   - Each string should contain exactly one letter
//   - These represent the hand of letters that the player has drawn
// - The letters should be randomly drawn from a pool of letters
//   - This letter pool should reflect the distribution of letters as described in the table below
// - Invoking this function should **not** change the pool of letters
//   - Imagine that the user returns their hand to the pool before drawing new letters


const Adagrams = {

  
  drawLetters() {
    // Implement this method for wave 1
  },
};

// Do not remove this line or your tests will break!
export default Adagrams;
