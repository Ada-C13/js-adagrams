# Assignment Submission: JS Adagrams

Congratulations! You're submitting your assignment. Please reflect on the assignment with these questions.

## Reflection

Prompt | Response
--- | ---
What patterns were you able to use from your Ruby knowledge to apply to JavaScript? | The algorithms were absolutely the same with a room to refactor given that suddenly adagrams makes more sense now than it did months ago. |
Did you need to use different strategies to find information online about JavaScript than you would for Ruby? | LOTS of Googling and LOTS of stackoverflow. It felt like I knew what methods I needed to use but having to look up the equivalent of it in JS. |
What was something you needed to do independent research on for this project? What did you learn? | Looking for other tutorials, other websites that went over certain aspectso of JS, youtube videos, asking mentors and tutors. I learned that I am more resourceful and able to pull together information that eventually makes sense to me better than I would ever give myself credit for given how odd JS can be. |
What was a challenge you were able to overcome on this assignment? | The syntatical differences were really the worst part and the next worst part was probably the overwhelming fear of not being able to learn a new language. Putting it off to mull about it made it worse, too. Not sure how to overcome the fear of learning a new language, but the fear of missing a project was worse. So, once I got started, it was "not that bad, really should have started sooner except my laptop broke but we are good now." |
What has been interesting and positive about learning a new programming language? | The most positive thing is realizing I do know some things, more than I think I do. The interesting thing is the amazement I was able to recognize what I needed to do without depending on the ruby adagrams. Being able to know what you need to do based on one language and looking up how to do that thing for another language proved to be satisfying. |
What is something to focus on your learnings in JavaScript in the next week? | Seeing the parallels between what I know in Ruby and applying the same algorithms/ideas to produce JS code. Also, just being comfortable with looking at JS code, all the curly brackets are intense. |
